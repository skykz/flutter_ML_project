# The following section is specific to Flutter.
flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
   - assets/   
   - assets/images/location_icon.png
   - assets/images/monument.png
   - assets/images/map.svg
   - assets/images/switch-camera.svg
   - assets/images/mode-map.svg
   - assets/images/minus.svg
   - assets/images/more.svg
   - assets/images/compass.svg




  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
      - family: Rubik
        fonts:
          - asset: assets/fonts/Rubik/Rubik-Light.ttf
            weight: 300
          - asset: assets/fonts/Rubik/Rubik-Regular.ttf
            weight: 400

  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
